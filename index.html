        <div id="general-info">
            Satoru Gojo is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.
            He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and strongest in the world often called the pinnacle of the jujutsu
            world.
            Satoru Gojo was born on December 7, 1989. After he was born, the balance of power shifted and Gojo had a
            bounty put on his head and was targeted by bounty hunters.
            Due to this, Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the
            Six Eyes in four hundred years.
            Currently, he works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train
            strong young allies.
        </div>
        <div id="appearance-info">
            Satoru Gojo is a tall man, towering over his students, and is considered to be very attractive by many
            people.
            He has white hair that's often spiked up, but Gojo lets it down when he's in more casual attire.
            Gojo has bright blue eyes, but they're usually covered by his signature black blindfold or a pair of dark
            sunglasses.
            While working, Gojo wears an all-black high-necked jacket with matching pants and dark dress boots.
            In the past, Gojo has worn bandages over his eyes rather than his simple blindfold.
            He has several casual attires that usually include long-sleeved shirts and slacks.
            He even wears long-sleeved hoodies to the beach with black swim trunks.
        </div>
        <div id="personality-info">
            Satoru Gojo is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students,
            close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives and his
            enemies. Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing
            himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and
            he is quite apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for
            power, he is very arrogant. With all that said, there is a human side to him. Furthermore, Satoru was later
            left visibly horrified and
            panicked after learning that Suguru, his one and only best friend, had become a murderous curse user. Satoru
            attempted to reason with his friend, but eventually realized and accepted that he lost the one person he
            truly saw as an equal. After having to put an end to Suguru before more calamity arose, it was Satoru's
            trauma over losing his best friend that caused his ultimate downfall in Shibuya. He was also distraught when
            Yuji seemingly died.
            Satoru's endgame is to reform the jujutsu world from the bottom-up through education. He seeks to foster a
            new generation of sorcerers that he hopes will one day become his equals.
